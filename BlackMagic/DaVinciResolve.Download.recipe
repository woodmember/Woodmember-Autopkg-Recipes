    <string>Downloads latest version of DaVinci Resolve Studio 18 by default. You can modify this to download any available
			legacy version as well. You can also configure this to download Studio and Lite.
		
			This recipe requires the use of the fantastic BlackMagicURLProvider processor, created by venerable timsutton. 
			You will need to add this processor to your autopkg instance. The Processor can be found on his Github:
			https://github.com/autopkg/timsutton-recipes/tree/master/Blackmagic . You will need to add his repo in order for
	    		this recipe to function.

			This product requires registration in order to download, so
			you _must_ override all input variables beginning with 'REG_'
			and they must contain data.

			Notably, REG_COUNTRY must contain sane values:
			- REG_COUNTRY is of the form 'us', 'ca', 'au', etc.
